# Spellcrammer
A spell management for D&amp;D casters.
This program will help D&D players manage spell loadouts. 
It will include only basic classes from edition 3.5 (for now). 
It scrapes d20SRD with BeautifulSoup based on player class and player level and prints that information. 
It will be considered successful if players can spend more time playing and less time flipping through spell information.
