# Spellcrammer
A spell management for D&amp;D casters.
This program will help D&D players manage spell loadouts. 
It will include only basic classes from edition 3.5 (for now). 
It scrapes d20SRD based on player class and player level and just outputs for now.
It will be considered successful if players can spend more time playing and less time flipping through spell information.
Integration with other popular RPG programs is not currently in scope but would be nice to have.
